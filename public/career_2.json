    "summary": "Bluetooth connected device which visualizes audio data by coloring LED lamp based on the dominant frequency from the spectrum. To implement this proof-of-concept, I have to write both ARM baremetal program which gets command and data from the Android phone via bluetooth and Android GUI Application which sends command and data to the board",
    "description": "I had been working as a hardware engineer since 2006 to 2009 and my interest started to move slowly to embedded software because I was so fascinated to the power which embedded software can bring to the simple device. so I started to study baremetal programing using low-cost micro controller kit (at that time, mostly 8 bit ATMEL MCU based) and after 2 years from the begining, I could achive proficiency in writing programs, debugging in free hosting (baremetal) environment into various targets (including ATMEL / ARM Cortex-M / TI MSP Series) with low cost programmer (e.g. JLINK)",
